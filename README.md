- 👋 Hi, I’m @sharmadhruv741
- 👀 I’m interested in learning Web Development.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning that through a course offered by the University of Helsinki where I'm learning Full Stack Web Development by learning to build Web apps using React, Node and other cool stuff.
- 💞️ I’m not looking for any collaborations right now. Knowing my way around the technology is more important for me right now.
- 📫 I'll just mention my email here anyway though - sharmadhruv741@gmail.com
